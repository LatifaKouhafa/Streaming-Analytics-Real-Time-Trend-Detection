# 📊 Streaming Analytics – Real-Time Trend Detection

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to **analyze data in real time** in order to understand **what is happening as it happens**.

I built a **streaming data pipeline** that continuously receives messages (simulating tweets), processes them immediately, and displays real-time indicators to detect emerging trends.

The goal is to reproduce a **real business use case**, such as trend detection or real-time system monitoring.

##  Business Problem

In many contexts (social media, e-commerce, finance, monitoring), batch processing is not sufficient.

**Business needs:**
- Detect trends as soon as they appear  
- React quickly to events  
- Monitor systems continuously  

Streaming enables **immediate decision-making**, not delayed analysis.

##  How It Works

The pipeline runs continuously:

1. Messages are generated in real time (mock tweets)
2. They are sent to Kafka
3. Spark processes them in streaming mode
4. Aggregated results are stored in a database
5. A dashboard displays the data in real time
